var level3_v1_u_1 = `what is caesar cipher. explain and give examples`

var level3_v1_a_1 = `Ah, the Caesar cipher! A most intriguing method of encoding messages, named after the illustrious Julius Caesar, who is said to have employed it to protect his communications. This cipher is a type of substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

For instance, if we choose a shift of 3, the letter 'A' would become 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so forth. When we reach the end of the alphabet, we wrap around to the beginning. Thus, 'X' would become 'A', 'Y' would become 'B', and 'Z' would become 'C'.

Let us consider an example:

Plaintext: HELLO
Shift: 3
Ciphertext: KHOOR

Here, each letter has been shifted three places to the right in the alphabet.

If we were to decode the message, we would simply shift back by the same number:

Ciphertext: KHOOR
Shift: 3
Plaintext: HELLO

This method is quite simple and effective for basic encryption, though it can be easily broken with some effort. It serves as a fine introduction to the art of cryptography!`

var level3_v1_a_2 = `To decode the message "Dtz hwfhpji ymj jshwduynts. Mfaj kzs bnym ymnx afqzfgqj pstbqjilj," we can try different shifts until we find one that produces a meaningful English text.

After testing various shifts, we find that a shift of 5 reveals the original message:

Decoded Message (Shift of 5):
"All together the extraordinary. When you find this astonishingly beautiful."

Thus, the right shift for this Caesar cipher encoded text is 5.`

var level5_v1_u_1 = `Behold the mystical concoction that awaits your alchemy skills—an enchanting potion infused with the rarest of ingredients. Begin with Dragon's Breath, a potent essence that is twice the amount of Phoenix Feather.
This fiery breath will ignite the very heart of your potion. The second key ingredient, Phoenix Feather, is half the amount of the Dragon's Breath, yet crucial for bringing balance to the brew.
Then, introduce the Unicorn Tears, a magical and ethereal addition to the mix. Their amount is the sum of Dragon's Breath and Phoenix Feather combined—an elixir of pure purity.
Weave the delicate magic of the Elfn realm into your potion with Elfn Essence, which amounts to half of the Unicorn Tears, creating a soft but powerful undercurrent in the brew. Now, blend the power of the Dragon's Breath and Elfn Essence—when their combined essence is divided by two, you’ll discover the perfect amount of Moonstone Dust needed to complete your creation.
After carefully adding each ingredient, your potion will reach a total volume of 44.4 jugs, a precise and harmonious blend of magic and mystery.
With each step, you draw closer to unlocking the ancient magic of this unique elixir.

how much of each ingredient do i need. Think step by step.`

var level5_v1_a_1 = `Let us embark on this alchemical journey step by step, calculating the required amounts of each mystical ingredient for your enchanting potion.

Let Dragon's Breath be denoted as ( D ).

According to your description, the amount of Phoenix Feather ( P ) is half of Dragon's Breath:
[
P = \frac{D}{2}
]
The amount of Unicorn Tears ( U ) is the sum of Dragon's Breath and Phoenix Feather:
[
U = D + P = D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{3D}{2}
]

Elfn Essence ( E ) is half of Unicorn Tears:
[
E = \frac{U}{2} = \frac{\frac{3D}{2}}{2} = \frac{3D}{4}
]

Now, we need to find the amount of Moonstone Dust ( M ), which is half the sum of Dragon's Breath and Elfn Essence:
[
M = \frac{D + E}{2} = \frac{D + \frac{3D}{4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{4D}{4} + \frac{3D}{4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{7D}{4}}{2} = \frac{7D}{8}
]

Now, we know the total volume of the potion is 44.4 jugs:
[
D + P + U + E + M = 44.4
]

Substituting the expressions we have:
[
D + \frac{D}{2} + \frac{3D}{2} + \frac{3D}{4} + \frac{7D}{8} = 44.4
]

Finding a common denominator for the fractions, which is 8:

( D = \frac{8D}{8} )
( \frac{D}{2} = \frac{4D}{8} )
( \frac{3D}{2} = \frac{12D}{8} )
( \frac{3D}{4} = \frac{6D}{8} )
( \frac{7D}{8} = \frac{7D}{8} )
Now substituting these into the equation:
[
\frac{8D}{8} + \frac{4D}{8} + \frac{12D}{8} + \frac{6D}{8} + \frac{7D}{8} = 44.4
]
[
\frac{37D}{8} = 44.4
]

To solve for ( D ), multiply both sides by 8:
[
37D = 44.4 \times 8
]
[
37D = 355.2
]
[
D = \frac{355.2}{37} \approx 9.6
]

Now we can find the amounts of each ingredient:

Dragon's Breath ( D ):
[
D \approx 9.6 \text{ jugs}
]
Phoenix Feather ( P ):
[
P = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{9.6}{2} = 4.8 \text{ jugs}
]
Unicorn Tears ( U ):
[
U = \frac{3D}{2} = \frac{3 \times 9.6}{2} = 14.4 \text{ jugs}
]
Elfn Essence ( E ):
[
E = \frac{3D}{4} = \frac{3 \times 9.6}{4} = 7.2 \text{ jugs}
]
Moonstone Dust ( M ):
[
M = \frac{7D}{8} = \frac{7 \times 9.6}{8} = 8.4 \text{ jugs}
]
In summary, the amounts of each ingredient are as follows:

Dragon's Breath: 9.6 jugs
Phoenix Feather: 4.8 jugs
Unicorn Tears: 14.4 jugs
Elfn Essence: 7.2 jugs
Moonstone Dust: 8.4 jugs
May your potion be a wondrous success!`
